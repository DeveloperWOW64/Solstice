			<h3>Hello. I'm a developer.</h3>
			<p>
				Welcome! My name is Jupiter. My pronouns are 'he/him'. I currently know bits of XAML, Python and Svelte.
				Obviously, nobody is infallible and so I may make mistakes. If such an event occurs, feel free to tell me - I wouldn't be hurt.
				Here's an interesting fact about me.. I can recite Ï€ to 16 decimal places: 3.1415926535897932.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Something I like to do while I'm not sitting down at my DELL XPS laptop is listen to music - just get lost in the wave of sounds.
				My favourite movie right now is by far Encanto of Disney. My favourite video game would be Miitopia.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the way, those cats' names are Hope and Joy, my great-aunt's sister cats. The're both very cute - though Hope can get up to a lot of trouble..
