# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Fluxduct!

### What is Flux?

Flux is the name of an 'fkcd' programming language. Flux aims to bring coding to all ages, as well as making it easier for those already coding.

### What is 'fkcd'?

'Fkcd' or, 'fakeCommand' is basically the way Fluxduct works. Fluxduct interprets its own code, translates it into Python and then executes it. Because it is based on Python, those who have already been coding for quite some time can gradually change to Flux, as Python code still works.
