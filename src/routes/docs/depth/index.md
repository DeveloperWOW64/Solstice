# ðŸ§¸ The CDLS Protocol

### What is the CDLS Protocol?

The Cuddles Depth Library System; the CDLS Protocol - my largest project yet. The CDLS Protocol is a library of assets and games for all ages. Some of the standard games include the original 'Cuddles' as well as various titles such as 'Turtle' and more. Developers can also create their own games using the assets and system; still running on the same platform and service. Not *yet* set to release.

### When is the release date?

The CDLS Protocol doesn't have a release date - *yet* - but for all I know it could be scrapped.

### What does CDLS mean?

CDLS means Cuddles Depth Library System - 'S' can mean Service in some scenarios.
Each individual word has a meaning and explanation attributed to it.

Cuddles - its originally intended title and inspiration

Depth - its codename

Library - its library of 'assets'

System/Service - self-explanatory
