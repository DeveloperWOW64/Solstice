# 🧑‍💻 Hello! Pleased to meet you! 

### I'm a developer from the UK.

- 🌱 I'm still learning UWP and computer development, so if I get something wrong, please tell me!
- 📁 Check out a cool project called [Files](https://github.com/files-community/). It's a file-explorer app that looks really nice and has some fantastic features!
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I can recite [π](https://www.piday.org/) to 16 decimal places (off by-heart and for no reason).
- 📮 Have a question about a project or something else? Feel free to submit an issue, chat in a discusion, or if you want to be more discrete, send me an [email!](mailto:devwow64@gmail.com)
